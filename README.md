# Summarize the project and what problem it was solving.
In this project, I created a program that helps users calculate returns on investments made into a savings account over a user-selected number of years. The program prints out two tables, one showing how much interest is made if the user only puts in an initial deposit and lets the interests add up over time, and a second table that allows the user to calculate interests with a set amount deposited each month on top of the initial deposit.

# What did you do particularly well?
My code made great use of functions in order to keep the main funciton simple and clear. The functions that I used helped caluculate interests earned and print out the two tables.

# Where could you enhance your code? How would these improvements make your code more efficient, secure, and so on?
While I did use funcitons effectively, I believe I could have created another function to get user input and clear up the main function even more. This would help make future modifications of my code more efficient as well by only requiring modification on the helper functions and not the main function itself. 

# Which pieces of the code did you find most challenging to write, and how did you overcome this? What tools or resources are you adding to your support network?
The most challenging part of writing this code was ensuring that the interest calculation worked with monthly deposits. To overcome this challenge, I had to look back in the textbook and look at examples of code that could be useful in this situation. I found an example that used a placeholder variable to hold some information and used that concept to correctly add the monthly deposit and interst made per month.

# What skills from this project will be particularly transferable to other projects or course work?
A skill that this project helped me put into practice is the use of functions. Creating functions and being able to apply them throughout a program are essential tools for any project. Doing so allows a program to be written clearly and without as much repetition.

# How did you make this program maintainable, readable, and adaptable?
To help make this program readable, I commented the purpose and use of every function and variable on all my functions. I kept comments equally spaced out in order to make the program look cleaner and easier to read. I also tried to keep the main function small in order to fully use functions and ease readibility.
